Growth rate: indicates the change in the number of cells or cell mass per unit of time. The time interval during which two daughter cells are formed from a single cell is called generation. The generation time is therefore the time needed for a population to duplicate and is also called duplication time. Bacteria have different generation times depending on the specific conditions like available nutrients, environmental parameters. A complete bacterial growth curve, such as that obtained in a closed container (closed system or batch culture) can be divided into several phases: lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase and death phase. The growth of a bacterial population inoculated into fresh medium usually begins after a more or less long period of time called the lag phase. The speed of exponential growth is variable and influenced both by environmental conditions (temperature, soil, atmosphere) and by the genetic characteristics of the microorganism. The exponential growth of a batch culture cannot continue indefinitely, it is self-limiting. Generally the end of this phase is determined by the exhaustion of essential nutrients or by the accumulation of waste products released. In this case the cell population enters the stationary phase. Although there is no net growth (unchanged cell number), many cellular functions, such as energy metabolism and some biosynthetic processes, can continue in this phase. Some bacteria show cryptic growth at this stage, some cells divide, while others die, so the number of cells remains constant. If the incubation continues, the culture enters the death phase where the total cell count may remain constant while the viable count slowly decreases. When death is accompanied by cell lysis, both turbidity and total cell number decrease. Every organism grows in a certain pH range, within which it is possible to identify an optimal pH. The intracellular pH must remain close to neutral to prevent the destruction of acid or alkaline-labile cellular macromolecules. Different environmental pH conditions could lead to particular cellular adaptations adopted by bacteria to survive. 2.2 Binary fission The reproduction of bacteria occurs through the division of an individual into two daughter cells (cytokinesis) equal to each other and identical to the progenitor and is defined as binary fission. The time it takes for a bacterium to complete a complete growth cycle is variable and depends on various nutritional and genetic factors. 2.3 Biofilm Biofilms are mainly composed of microbial cells and EPS. EPS can represent 50% to 90% of the total organic carbon of biofilms and can be considered the primary matrix material of biofilms. EPS can vary in chemical and physical properties, but is primarily composed of polysaccharides. Biofilm-associated organisms also differ from their planktonic (freely suspended) counterparts in the genes that are transcribed. The solid-liquid interface between a surface and an aqueous medium (e.g. water, blood) provides an ideal environment for the attachment and growth of microorganisms. The basic structural unit of the biofilm is the microcolony. The proximity of cells within the microcolony (or between microcolonies) provides an ideal environment for the creation of nutrient gradients, gene exchange, and quorum sensing. Because microcolonies can be composed of multiple species, cycling of various nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon) through redox reactions can easily occur in aquatic biofilms and soil. Biofilms also provide an ideal niche for the exchange of extrachromosomal DNA (plasmids). Conjugation (the mechanism of plasmid transfer) occurs at a greater rate between cells in biofilms than between planktonic cells. 2.4 Absorbance 2.5 Calibration curve 2.6 Winogradsky Column 2.7 Dilution 2.8 Isolation cultures "],["microbial-metabolisms.html", "Chapter 3 Microbial Metabolisms 3.1 Phototrophy 3.2 Chemotrophy 3.3 Autotrophy 3.4 Heterotrophy 3.5 Photoautotrophy 3.6 Photoheterotrophy 3.7 Chemoorganotrophy 3.8 Chemolithotrophy 3.9 Fermentation 3.10 Methanogenesis 3.11 Sulphate-reduction", " Chapter 3 Microbial Metabolisms 3.1 Phototrophy Phototrophs get energy from sunlight and use carbon from carbon dioxide or organic carbon. 3.2 Chemotrophy Chemotrophs get energy from the oxidation of electron donors in their environments. 3.3 Autotrophy Autotrophs use \\(CO_{2}\\) as a carbon source (inorganic). 3.4 Heterotrophy Heterotrophs carry out the biological oxidation of organic compounds, used a carbon source, to ATP (energy source) and simpler organic or inorganic compounds, which are needed by the bacterial cell for biosynthetic or assimilatory reactions. All heterotrophic bacteria require preformed organic compounds. 3.5 Photoautotrophy Photoautotrophs use sunlight as energy source and \\(CO_{2}\\) as carbon source. They carry out photosynthesis, fixing atmospheric carbon (\\(CO_{2}\\)) using light energy. 3.6 Photoheterotrophy Photoheterotrophs get their energy from sunlight and carbon from organic material and not carbon dioxide. Photoheterotrophs use organic compounds from the environment; these compounds include carbohydrates, fatty acids and alcohols. 3.7 Chemoorganotrophy Chemoorganotrophs use organic chemicals as an energy source (electron donors) and organic compounds as carbon source. 3.8 Chemolithotrophy Chemolitotrophs use inorganic chemicals as an energy source (electron donors) and inorganic compounds as carbon source. 3.9 Fermentation 3.10 Methanogenesis There is a group of Archaea, known as methanogens that produce methane in the final step of biomass decomposition. Methanogens don’t use oxygen, they are anaerobic microorganisms, and use oxidized compounds as final electron acceptors. There are 3 methanogenic pathways: Hydrogenotrophic: the hydrogen is used to reduce \\(CO_{2}\\) to methane. Methylotrophic: methyl compounds are reduced to methane in presence or not of hydrogen. Acetoclastic: acetate is used to produce methane and \\(CO_{2}\\). Methanogenesis is the last step of biomass decomposition in which electron acceptors (oxygen, iron, sulphate, nitrate, manganese) are spent completely, and hydrogen, carbon dioxide and organic matter are accumulated.  Methanogenesis is an ancient metabolic pathway carried out by methanogens, (around 2.5 billions years), before oxygen became abundant in the atmosphere. It represents the biggest biotic sources of methane on Earth. This process has a key role in the global carbon cycle with particular attention on climate changes linked to global warming due to methane. Initially, it is hard to isolate methanogens because they are strictly anaerobic microorganisms with specific growth requests. Moreover, it is difficult to create anaerobic conditions. Robert Hungtape is considered as the father of anaerobic microbiology. 3.11 Sulphate-reduction The microorganisms use the sulphate as nutrients, they reduce it to sulphide, and they incorporate it in amino acids containing sulphur. These microorganisms are known as SRB (sulphate-reducers bacteria), anaerobics that use sulphate as final electron acceptors for the degradation of organic compounds with the consequent sulphide production. Sulfur is among the most abundant elements on Earth: \\(FeS_{2}\\): pyrite (in the rocks, and sediments) \\(CaSO_{4}\\): gypsum (in the rocks, and sediments) Sulphate: seawater Its oxidation states are from -2 (completely reduced) a +6 (completely oxidized).

The mixtures can be separated in different ways: Filtration: is a method used to separate solid components from liquid or gaseous substances. Centrifuge: is a method used to separate solid substances from the liquids, exploiting the centrifuge force. In this way, the solid particles settle on the bottom whereas the liquid substance remains in the upper portion; this liquid phase is called supernatant. Decantation: is a process for separating mixtures by removing a precipitate-free liquid layer or settled solids from a solution, based on gravity. The aim may be to obtain a decanted liquid (particulate-free liquid) or to recover the precipitate. For the preparation of a solution, some aspects have to be considered. For example, solute solubility has to be known because some problems can occur for the saturation of solution. Moreover, it should be careful that the solute is well dissolved in the solvent. When the solution is clear, it has to be filtered to avoid any kind of microbial contamination: in most cases, the solution is sterilised through filtration using filters 0.22 µm: sometimes, autoclave is used to sterilise a solution depending on the kind of solute present into. Another question is correlated to the use of plastic cylinder or glass ones, depending on the temperature used for dissolving (room temperature or high temperature) or on the requirement for the metal-free solution. 4.2 Solubility The solubility indicates the quantity of a solute dissolved in a solvent. The solubility may be expressed by using different unite of measures indicating the concentration of a solution: ppm is the acronym of “parts per millions”, and it can be also expressed in milligrams per Liter (mg/L); it corresponds to 1 µg/mL. This unit of measure indicates how many milligrams of a solute are present in 1 liter of solution. ppt is the acronym of “parts per thousands” - and it can be also expressed in milligrams per 100 mL (mg/100 mL); it corresponds to 1 µg/mL. This unit of measure indicates how many milligrams of a solute are present in 100 milliliters of solution. ppb is the acronym of “parts per billions” - and it can be also expressed in micrograms per Liter (ug/L). This unit of measure indicates how many micrograms of a solute are present in 1 liter of solution. Concentration (w/w): corresponds to weight of a solute in 100 mg of solution Concentration (V/V): corresponds to volume of a solute in 100 mL of solution Concentration (w/V): corresponds to weight of a solute in 100 mL of solution Molarity (M = mol/L): corresponds to number of moles of solute in 1 L of solution. The solubility of most solid substances is affected by the temperature: if the temperature increases, the solubility increases. The solubility of gas has a different behaviour: if the temperature increases, the solubility decreases. 4.3 Temperature Temperature is a physical quantity that is a measure of hotness or coldness of matter or radiation. Temperature is measured with a thermometer. The most common scales are the Celsius scale (with the unit °C), the Fahrenheit scale (with the unit °F), and the Kelvin scale (with the unit K). Conversion between the temperature scales (add TABLE) 4.4 pH and pOH - pondus Hydrogenium and pondus OH In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. pH = \\(-log_{10}[H^{+}]\\) The pOH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. pOH = \\(-log_{10}[OH^{-}]\\) At 25°C (77°F), solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH higher than 7 are basic. Solutions with a pH of 7 at this temperature are neutral (for example pure water, in which there is the same concentration of \\(H^{+}\\) ions as \\(OH^{-}\\) ions). To calculate the concentration of \\(H^{+}\\) or \\(OH^{-}\\) in a sample with a specific pH/pOH value: \\([H^{+}]\\) = \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\([OH^{-}]\\) = \\(10^{-pOH}\\) The pH is inversely proportional to the temperature of the solution. When the temperature of a solution increases, molecular vibrations in the solution increase causing ionization and the formation of \\(H^{+}\\) ions. More \\(H^{+}\\) ions lead to more acidic behaviour. Due to temperature changes, the pH value of the solution changes. Therefore, pH decreases as temperature increases. The pH is measured with a pHmeter. If the pHmeter has the temperature probe, the pH value is calculated considering the probable changes due to temperature. If the pHmeter has not the temperature probe, the real pH value should be calculated with a pH temperature correction calculator. The pH value is an important variable, since it can control biological or chemical processes, the availability of nutrients or even the activity of microorganisms. 4.5 MVpH - MilliVolt pH The pH probe is generally a glass electrode that measures the difference in electrical potential on two sides of a thin glass membrane placed at the end of the electrode; this potential difference is linked to the difference between the concentrations of hydrogen ions at the inside and outside the membrane. A standard pH sensor outputs a millivolt (mV) signal, which corresponds to a pH value. Moving one pH unit along the scale in any direction will correspond to a change in voltage of 59 mV. - An output of 0 mV is equal to pH 7. - An output, included between 0 and -414.12 mV (7 x -59 mV), indicates pH &gt; 7 - An output, included between 0 and +414.12 mV (7 x 59 mV), indicates pH &lt; 7 4.6 ORP - Oxidation Reduction Potential ORP is a numerical index of the intensity of oxidizing or reducing conditions within a system. Positive values for ORP indicate oxidizing conditions, whereas negative values indicate reducing conditions. ORP can also be viewed as a representation of electron availability. Since reducing agents donate electrons, a reducing environment is one in which electrons are relatively available. In contrast, an oxidizing environment is one in which electrons are relatively unavailable. Oxidation and reduction are related chemical processes that refer to the exchange of electrons in a reaction. Oxidation refers to when a chemical substance loses electrons. Reduction refers to when a chemical substance gains electrons, so reduction is the opposite of oxidation. Both oxidation and reduction can occur in the same reaction, which is why reactions involving oxidation and reduction are often called redox reactions. Chemicals (such as oxygen) that accept electrons from other compounds are called oxidizing agents, while substances (such as methane or hydrogen) that donate electrons are called reducing agents. Redox is expressed as electrical potential (voltage). Generally, a reducing environment is indicated by a negative reading, while an oxidizing environment is indicated by a positive reading. The most common unit for expressing redox potential is the millivolt (mV). 4.7 DO - Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen is the quantity of oxygen gas (O2), dissolved in water.  In general, natural chemical processes dissolve gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the water until saturation is reached. The amount of oxygen that can be absorbed depends on many factors, such as temperature, salinity and pressure. The greatest consumption of oxygen in water occurs through the respiration of animals, microbes and plants, but also through the decomposition of dead organic matter by microbes and fungi. Additionally, dissolved oxygen can decrease when the water body warms. In fact, for the preparation of anaerobic medium, the solutions are placed on a hot plate in order to cause the oxygen leakage, and to create an anaerobic environment. Dissolved oxygen is usually reported in milligrams per Liter (mg/L), in parts per million (ppm) or micromoles (umol). The oxygen concentration is also expressed as a percentage of saturation, which is the amount of oxygen present compared to the maximum value (100%) which could be contained in a specific air volume. 4.8 Conductibility (spc) Electrical conductivity, also called EC value (EC means “electrical conductivity”), is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity. The SI unit of conductivity is Siemens per meter (S/m). This parameter depends on the substances dissolved in a solution. Conductivity measurements are routinely used in many industrial and environmental applications as a quick, economical, and reliable method of measuring the ionic content in a solution. In many cases, conductivity is directly linked to total dissolved solids (TDS). 4.9 TDS - Total Dissolved Solids Total dissolved solids (TDS) is a measure of the combined dissolved content of all inorganic and organic substances present in water. Total dissolved solids (TDS) include inorganic salts, primarily calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates, and some small amounts of organic matter that are dissolved in water. TDS concentrations are usually in parts per million (ppm). 4.10 Salinity The salinity describes the amount of dissolved salts in a liquid. In most cases, sodium chloride (NaCl) represents the largest percentage of dissolved salts. Typical units for salt content are g/kg (g salt per kg of solution), %, ppt or even PSU. There is a proportionality between the salinity and conductivity. If a salt content increases, the conductivity value increases. For this reason, the salinity values can be calculated, if the conductivity value is known. 4.11 Density The density of a substance is the ratio between the mass of the substance and volume (how much space it takes up). Its unit of measure in the International System is kg/m3. 4.12 Alcalinity Alkalinity is a measure of water’s ability to resist pH changes that lead to acidity, or to neutralize acids and maintain a stable pH. This capacity is usually referred to as the “buffer capacity” of water. The presence of some chemical substances, including hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, affects the alkalinity of water. In simple terms, water with high alkalinity is less likely to become more acidic if it is contaminated with acidic water, such as acid rain. Alkalinity is measured by a process called titration. An acid of known concentration, called a titrant, is added to the water.The amount of acid used to bring the water up to a specific pH level is determined by the alkalinity of the water. Once the water reaches the pH end point, it changes colour. Alkalinity is measured in units of milligrams per liter (mg/L) of calcium carbonate \\((CaCO_{3})\\). Alkaline water has a pH of 8 or higher. The pH scale is used to measure the alkalinity of water.Water with a pH between 8 and 10 is considered slightly alkaline, while water with a pH above 10 is considered very alkaline. A pH of 7 is neutral, while anything below 7 is considered acidic. 4.13 Melting Temperature It can refer to: Melting point: is the temperature at which a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state Melting temperature: is the temperature at which the DNA double helix dissociates into single strands. 4.14 Gas laws \\(Henry’s law\\) The solubility of a gas in a liquid sample is directly proportional to pressure gas on the liquid phase. Example: in a carbonated drink, the carbon dioxide (gas) is present and it exercises a pressure in the bottle, higher than atmospheric pressure, which allows it to be soluble in the liquid phase. When the bottle is opened, the carbon dioxide pressure decreases with the consequent decreasing of its solubility. The observed result is the leakage of many bubbles from the liquid phase. \\(Boyle’s law\\) At constant temperature, a gas volume is inversely proportional to subjected pressure P x V = k \\(Charles’ law\\) At constant pressure, a gas volume is directly proportional to its temperature V/T = k "],["geochemistry.html", "Chapter 5 Geochemistry 5.1 Sulphide 5.2 Iron 5.3 DOC - Dissolved Organic Carbon 5.4 DIC - Dissolved Inorganic Carbon 5.5 EA - Elemental Analysis 5.6 ICP-ms - Inductively Coupled Plasma - mass spectrometry 5.7 IC - Ion Chromatography 5.8 Isotope 5.9 POM - Particulate Organic Matter", " Chapter 5 Geochemistry 5.1 Sulphide Sulfide \\((S^{2-})\\) is a divalent inorganic anion obtained by removal of both protons from hydrogen sulfide which is a gas that has a “rotten egg” smell. Sulfide is often present in environmental samples, produced either biologically by decomposition of organic matter and bacterial reduction of sulfate or inorganically by volcanic degassing. Sulfide is often present in environmental samples, produced biologically by the decomposition of organic matter and bacterial reduction of sulfate or inorganic from volcanic degassing. There are four categories of sulfides in water and sediment samples, operationally defined as follows: Total sulfide: includes dissolved \\((H_{2}S)\\) and HS and acid-volatile metal sulfides present in particulates. Dissolved sulfide: This is what remains after the suspended solids have been removed by flocculation and settling. Flocculation and sedimentation are used to separate dissolved and particulate sulfide since sulfide can be oxidized during filtration. Centrifugation can also be used. Acid-volatile sulfide: Includes amorphous iron monosulfides, including mackinawite (FeS), greigite \\((Fe_{3}S_{4})\\), and pyrrhotite (FeS), and amorphous monosulfides of other metals. Pyrite, another sulfide mineral, is not included in the acid-volatile sulfides. Non-ionized hydrogen sulfide: it can be calculated from the concentration of dissolved sulfide, the pH of the sample, and the conditional ionization constant of \\((H_{2}S)\\). 5.2 Iron Iron exists in two different states: - Ferrous \\((Fe^{2+})\\) or iron (II) - Ferric \\((Fe^{3+})\\) or iron (III) Iron can be converted from ferrous iron to ferric iron by the loss of an electron in the oxidation process. Iron has low solubility in water, so it is a limiting factor. Ferrous iron \\((Fe^{2+})\\) oxidizes easily to ferric iron \\((Fe^{3+})\\) when exposed to air: this is the reason why, in the field sampling, the collected sample must be acidifed by adding a few drops of concentrated \\(HCl\\) or \\(HNO_{3}\\) as soon as possible. In fact, ferrous iron is stable in acidid samples. 5.3 DOC - Dissolved Organic Carbon Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally defined as organic matter capable of passing through a filter that removes material ranging in size from 0.70 to 0.22 mm. Sample dissolved organic carbon content is defined as the concentration of carbon remaining in a sample after all particulate carbon has been removed by filtration and all inorganic carbon has been removed by acidification and sparging. Prior to analysis, samples are acidified to reduce the pH below 2. At this pH = 2, all inorganic carbon species are converted to CO2 and removed from the sample. 5.4 DIC - Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is present in all natural waters. The concentration of DIC varies between 100 and 1000 μM in most systems. DIC is usually the most abundant form of carbon in water. DIC is made up of three main constituents: free carbon dioxide \\((CO_{2})\\) (a gas), the bicarbonate ion \\((HCO_{3}^{-})\\) and the carbonate ion \\((CO_{3}^{2-})\\). Bicarbonate and carbonate are the major buffers in most natural waters and account for the majority of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC; also called alkalinity). Free \\((CO^{2})\\) is the most dynamic of the DIC constituents and is the dominant acid in most natural waters. The ratio of \\((CO_{2})\\) to \\((HCO_{3}^{-})\\) and \\((CO_{3}^{2-})\\) is the primary control of pH in most natural waters. Carbon is a ubiquitous and important dissolved component of natural waters. Because CO2 is present in the atmosphere and because carbonate minerals are widespread, there is no sample of natural water that is totally free of inorganic carbon species. Aqueous carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid which is very unstable and will rapidly dissociate into hydrogen and bicarbonate. Therefore, in seawater, dissolved inorganic carbon is commonly referred to as the collection of bicarbonate, carbonate ions and dissolved carbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\), \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\), \\(CO_{3}^{2-}\\)). \\(CO_{2}\\) (aq) + \\(H_{2}O\\) ⇌ \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\) ⇌ \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\) + \\(H^{+}\\) ⇌ C\\(CO_{3}^{2-}\\) + \\(2H^{+}\\) Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid: \\(CO_{2}\\) + \\(H_{2}O\\) → \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\) Carbonic acid is a weak acid that dissociates to form its conjugate bases bicarbonate and carbonate: \\(H_{2}CO_{3}\\) → \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\) + \\(H^{+}\\) \\(HCO_{3}^{-}\\) → \\(CO_{3}^{2-}\\) + \\(H^{+}\\) 5.5 EA - Elemental Analysis Elemental analysis (EA) is an analytical technique applied in chemistry to determine the elemental composition of chemical compounds and their composites. Through this method, it can be determined which elements are present and how many percent by mass of each chemical element is contained in the tested substance to establish the empirical formula. Elemental analysis is often named CHNS or CHN analysis since it determines the amount of carbon \\((C)\\), hydrogen \\((H)\\), nitrogen \\((N)\\) and sulfur \\((S)\\). Elemental analysis can be qualitative (determining which elements are present) and can be quantitative (determining how much of each is present). 5.6 ICP-ms - Inductively Coupled Plasma - mass spectrometry Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is an analytical technique that can be used to measure elements at trace levels in biological fluids. Sample preparation for ICP-MS provides that the biological samples are usually diluted with acids: both liquid samples and solid samples can be subjected to this technique with the only difference that the latter ones have to be digested before. 5.7 IC - Ion Chromatography Ion chromatography (IC) is a form of liquid chromatography that uses ion exchange resins to separate atomic or molecular ions based on their interaction with the resin. Ion chromatography is applied for the analysis of major cations \\((Ca^{2+}, Na^{+}, K^{+}, Mg^{2+}, NH_{4}^{+})\\) and anions \\((Cl^{-}, Br^{-}, NO_{3}^{-}, NO_{2}^{-}, SO_{4}^{2-}, HPO_{4}^{2-})\\) in environmental samples. The results obtained are expressed in ppm, generally. 5.8 Isotope Isotopic analysis is the identification of the isotopic signature, indicating the abundance of certain stable isotopes of chemical elements within organic and inorganic compounds. It separates isotopes based on small but significant differences in mass. This can be done using an emission spectrometer or a mass spectrometer. With both types of instruments, the sample must be converted to gas before analysis. The resulting isotopic signature of a sample is expressed using a delta (δ) followed by the isotopic number and symbol of the element being measured. 5.9 POM - Particulate Organic Matter "],["biogeochemical-cycles.html", "Chapter 6 Biogeochemical Cycles 6.1 Water cycle 6.2 Carbon cycle 6.3 Nitrogen cycle 6.4 Phosphorus cycle 6.5 Sulphur cycle 6.6 Hydrogen cycle", " Chapter 6 Biogeochemical Cycles A biogeochemical cycle is represented by the transition of an element or compound between various compartiments characterised by living and non living forms. Biogeochemical cycles are also defined like the transfer of materials and energy among biotic and abiotic pools and they are dominated by microorganisms. Earth’s biogeochemistry is largely controlled by cycles of oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions. Organisms use redox reactions to derive energy by transferring electrons from a reduced chemical species (electron donor) to an oxidized chemical species (electron acceptor). Energy flows are dissipated as heat through an ecosystem, but chemical elements are recycled. The most fundamental elements for life is water, which contains hydrogen and oxygen, essential for living organisms. Organisms cannot live on water alone. However, there are some other key elements for life and are part of biogeochemical cycles: Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is also a key component of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is necessary for DNA, RNA and proteins and is essential for human agriculture. Phosphorus is a key component of DNA and RNA and is one of the main ingredients, along with nitrogen, in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture. Sulfur is critical to the structure of proteins and is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels. These cycles do not occur in isolation, and the water cycle is a important driver of other biogeochemical cycles. Although each element/compound follows its own path, all of these key chemical nutrients pass through the biosphere, moving between the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) worlds and between living organisms. 6.1 Water cycle Water is the only substance that exists naturally on Earth in all three physical states of matter, gas, liquid, and solid, changing from one form to another. Hydrological cycle is also known as the “water cycle”; it is the normal water recycling system on Earth. Due to solar radiation, water evaporates, generally from the sea, lakes, etc. Water also evaporates from plant leaves through the mechanism of transpiration. As the steam rises in the atmosphere, it is being cooled, condensed, and returned to the land and the sea as precipitation. Precipitation falls on the earth as surface water and shapes the surface, creating thus streams of water that result in lakes and rivers. A part of the water precipitating penetrates the ground and moves downward through the incisions, forming aquifers. Finally, a part of the surface and underground water leads to sea. It is expected that the hydrological cycle will be affected from global warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. 6.2 Carbon cycle The carbon cycle is probably the most fundamental biogeochemical process, without which life could not exist. Carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide \\((CO_{2})\\), represents the starting component in almost all food chains, while at the same time performing a complementary role as Earth’s thermostat, providing an equable climate, suitable for the retention of liquid water on the surface of the planet. The carbon cycle can be “schematized” by considering two interconnected subcycles: Short-Term Carbon Cycle Long-Term Carbon Cycle These subcycles are linked to each other. In the Short-Term Carbon Cycle, also called Fast carbon cycle, the main components are plants and phytoplankton. Autotrophs take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by absorbing it into their cells. Using energy from the sun, both plants and plankton combine carbon dioxide \\((CO_{2})\\) and water to form sugar \\((CH_{2}O)\\) and oxygen, in the process of photosynthesis. Heterotrophs break down the plant sugar to get energy, and organic carbon is passed through food chains. To release the energy stored in carbon-containing molecules, such as sugars, autotrophs and heterotrophs break down these molecules in a process called cellular respiration. In this process, the carbon atoms of the molecule are converted into carbon dioxide. Decomposers also release organic compounds and carbon dioxide when they break down dead organisms and waste products. In the Long-Term Carbon Cycle, also called “slow cycle”, the movement of carbon from the atmosphere to the lithosphere begins with rain. Atmospheric carbon combines with water to form a carbonic acid that falls to the surface in rain. The acid dissolves rocks — a process called chemical weathering — and releases calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium ions. Rivers carry the ions to the ocean. In the ocean, the calcium ions combine with bicarbonate ions to form calcium carbonate. Most of the calcium carbonate is made by shell-building (calcifying) organisms (such as corals) and plankton (like coccolithophores and foraminifera). After the organisms die, they sink to the seafloor. Over time, layers of shells and sediment are cemented together and turn to rock, storing the carbon in stone—limestone and its derivatives (limestone is a rock, made primarily of calcium carbonate. These rock types are often formed from the bodies of marine plants and animals, and their shells and skeletons can be preserved as fossils. Carbon locked up in limestone can be stored for millions—or even hundreds of millions—of years). Only 80% of carbon-containing rock is currently made this way. The remaining 20% contain carbon from living things (organic carbon) that have been embedded in layers of mud. Heat and pressure compress the mud and carbon over millions of years, forming sedimentary rock. On Earth, carbon is stored in the soil as organic carbon resulting from the decomposition of living organisms or as inorganic carbon resulting from weathering of Earth’s rocks and minerals. Deeper underground are fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas, which are the remains of organic matter decomposed under anaerobic conditions. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form. When humans burn them, the carbon is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Another way in which carbon enters the atmosphere is by erupting volcanoes. Carbon-containing sediments on the ocean floor are transported deep into the Earth in a process called subduction, in which one tectonic plate moves beneath another. This process forms carbon dioxide, which can be released into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions or hydrothermal vents. The human activities have a big impact on the carbon cycle. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because they are consumed much faster than they can be produced by geological processes. In addition to the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation also contributes significantly to the increase in \\(CO_{2}\\). Trees and other parts of the forest ecosystem sequester carbon, and much of the carbon is released as \\(CO_{2}\\) if the forest is cut down. Furthermore, while the oceans absorbing excess carbon dioxide might seem good from a greenhouse gas perspective, it may not be good at all from a marine life perspective. As we saw above, \\(CO_{2}\\) dissolved in seawater can react with water molecules to release H+ ions. So, dissolving more \\(CO_{2}\\) into the water causes the water to become more acidic. More acidic water can, in turn, reduce \\(CO_{3}^{2}\\) concentrations and make it more difficult for marine organisms to build and maintain their \\(CaCO_{3}\\) shells. Both rising temperatures and increased acidity can harm marine life. 6.3 Nitrogen cycle Nitrogen is a key component of living organisms. Nitrogen atoms are found in all proteins and DNA. Nitrogen is a common limiting nutrient in nature and agriculture. When fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus are transported in runoff to lakes and rivers, causing the phenomenon of eutrophication. \\(N_{2}\\) gas makes up about 78% of the Earth’s atmosphere by volume. In the process of nitrogen fixation, nitrogen enters the living world through bacteria and other single-celled prokaryotes, which convert atmospheric nitrogen \\(N_{2}\\) into biologically usable forms through nitrogenase enzyme complexes. The ammonium produced by nitrogen fixation is either assimilated into biomass or is further respired by aerobic and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing microbes. Nitrogen-fixing microorganisms capture atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into ammonium and aminoacids. There are some abiotic reactions fixing nitrogen that require high energy input to split the triple bond of \\(N_{2}\\). In the presence of extremely high temperatures, \\(N_{2}\\) molecules dissociate. A fraction of the dissociated nitrogen gets oxidized to form nitric oxide (\\(NO\\)) gas: \\(N_{2}\\) + \\(O_{2}\\) + energy → \\(2NO\\) The nitrogen can be also fixed in the Haber-Bosch process for fertilizer production. Ammonification may be accomplished either by reduction of dinitrogen (also referred to as ‘nitrogen fixation’), or by dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Ammonification and nitrification are the primary source for ammonium \\((NH_{4}^{+})\\). Nitrification is composed of oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (also referred to as ’nitritation), and of oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (also referred to as ’nitratation). The process of nitrification involves three cohorts of microorganisms: ammonia oxidizers that oxidize ammonia to nitrite (nitritation); nitrite oxidizers that oxidize nitrite to nitrate (nitratation);  complete ammonia oxidizers that oxidize ammonia all the way to nitrate (comammox). Denitrification describes the process of anaerobic respiration of nitrite \\((NO^{2-})\\), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide \\((N_{2}O)\\) to \\(N_{2}\\). Anammox, or anaerobic ammonium oxidation, utilizes the pools of \\(NO_{2}\\) and ammonium \\((NH_{4}^{+})\\) to form \\(N_{2}\\) via the intermediates \\(NO\\) and hydrazine \\((N_{2}H_{4})\\). Anammox is ecologically beneficial for wastewater treatment as it removes both nitrite and ammonium simultaneously without producing \\(N_{2}O\\), and has been industrially implemented at full scale. In general, human activity releases nitrogen into the environment through two main means: the burning of fossil fuels and the use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (through the Haber-Bosch process, in which \\(N_{2}\\) is reacted with hydrogen, \\(H_{2}\\), at high temperatures) in agriculture. Both processes increase levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. High levels of atmospheric nitrogen, other than \\(N_{2}\\), are associated with harmful effects, such as the production of acid rain, in the form of nitric acid, HNO3, and with contributions to the greenhouse effect, such as nitrous oxide, \\(N_[2}O\\). Furthermore, when artificial fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus are used in agriculture, excess fertilizer can be washed into lakes, streams and rivers through surface runoff. One of the main effects of fertilizer runoff is the eutrophication of saltwater and freshwater. In this process, nutrient runoff causes excessive growth, or a “bloom”, of algae or other microorganisms. Without nutrient runoff, their growth was limited by the availability of nitrogen or phosphorus. Eutrophication can reduce the availability of oxygen in water at night because algae and the microorganisms that feed on them consume large amounts of oxygen in cellular respiration. Moreover, some algae give water an unpleasant taste or odour or produce toxic compounds. This can cause the death of other organisms living in the affected ecosystems, such as fish and shrimp, and result in low-oxygen, species-depleted areas called dead zones. 6.4 Phosphorus cycle Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for all life forms. It is a key component of fundamental biochemicals, including genetic material (DNA, RNA), energy transferal molecules (e.g., adenosine triphosphate: ATP), and compounds that provide structural support to organisms in the form of membranes (phospholipids) and bone (the biomineral hydroxyapatite). Photosynthetic organisms at the base of the food web in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems require dissolved phosphorus, along with carbon and other essential nutrients, to build their tissues using energy from the sun. Biological productivity is contingent upon the availability of phosphorus to these organisms. The phosphorus cycle is slow. Most phosphorus in nature exists as a phosphate ion \\(PO_{4}^{3-}\\). In nature, phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient and this is especially true for aquatic and freshwater ecosystems. Phosphorus locked up in bedrock, soils, and sediments is not directly available to organisms. Conversion of unavailable forms to bioavailable forms (principally dissolved orthophosphate: \\(PO_{4}^{3-}\\), which can be directly assimilated, occurs through geochemical and biochemical reactions at various stages in the global phosphorus cycle. Production of biomass fueled by phosphorus bioavailability results in the deposition of organic matter in soil and sediments, where it acts as a source of fuel and nutrients to microbial communities. Microbial activity in soils and sediments, in turn, strongly influences the concentration and chemical form of phosphorus incorporated into the geological record. In terrestrial systems, phosphorus resides in three pools: bedrock, soil, and living organisms (biomass). Weathering of continental bedrock is the principal source of phosphorus to the soils that support continental vegetation; atmospheric deposition is relatively unimportant. Phosphorus is weathered from bedrock by dissolution of phosphorus-bearing minerals such as apatite, the most abundant primary phosphorus mineral in crustal rocks. Weathering reactions are driven by exposure of minerals to naturally occurring acids derived mainly from microbial activity. Phosphate liberated to soil solution during weathering is directly available for uptake by terrestrial plants, and is returned to the soil by decay of litterfall. Phosphorus is transferred from the continental to the oceanic reservoir primarily by rivers, deriving from weathered continental rocks and soils. Phosphorus circulates through the environment in three natural cycles. The first of these is the inorganic cycle, which refers to phosphorus in the crust of the Earth. Through millions of years, phosphorus has moved slowly through the inorganic cycle, starting with the rocks which slowly weather to form soil, from which the phosphorus is gradually leached from the land into rivers and onward to the sea, where it eventually forms insoluble calcium phosphate and sinks to the seafloor as sediment. There it remains until it is converted to new, so-called sedimentary rocks as a result of geological pressure. On a timescale of hundreds of millions of years, these sediments are uplifted to form new dry land and the rocks are subject to weathering, completing the global cycle. In addition, some phosphorus can be transferred back from the ocean to the land by fish-eating birds whose droppings have built up sizable deposits of phosphate as guano on Pacific coastal regions and islands, and by ocean currents that convey phosphorus from the seawater to these regions. The global cycle of phosphorus is unique among the cycles of the major biogeochemical elements in having no significant gaseous compounds. The other two cycles are organic ones which move phosphorus through living organisms as part of the food chain. These are a land-based phosphorus cycle which transfers it from soil to plants, to animals, and back to soil again; and a water-based organic cycle which circulates it among the creatures living in rivers, lakes, and seas. It is the amount of phosphorus in these two cycles that governs the biomass of living forms that land and sea can sustain. The ocean water loses phosphorus continually in a steady drizzle of detritus to the bottom, where it builds up in the sediments as insoluble calcium phosphate. Despite the geological remobilization, there is a net annual loss of millions of tons of phosphate a year from the marine biosphere. Thus the ocean sediments are by far the largest stock in the biogeochemical cycles of phosphorus. 6.5 Sulphur cycle The largest sulphur reservoirs on the Earth are iron sulphides (pyrite; \\(FeS_{2})\\) and gypsum \\((CaSO_{4})\\) in sediments and rocks and sulphate in seawater. Sulphur, which is a necessary element for life, is taken up as sulphate by microorganisms and plants, and subsequently by animals. Sulfur enters the atmosphere from natural sources as hydrogen sulfide \\((H_{2}S)\\) from active volcanoes and the decay of organic matter in anaerobic environments (swamps, tidal flats), sulfur dioxide \\((SO_{2})\\) from active volcanoes, and particles of sulfate salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) from sea spray. Decomposition of dead organisms in the absence of oxygen releases the sulphur again as hydrogen sulphide. The combustion of fossil fuels and emission of volcanic fumes releases sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, where it reacts with water, thereby forming sulphuric acid and resulting in acid rain. 6.6 Hydrogen cycle Serpentination Serpentinization involves the hydrolysis and transformation of primary ferromagnesian minerals such as olivine and pyroxenes to produce hydrogen-rich fluids and a variety of secondary minerals over a wide range of environmental conditions. In the process of serpentinization, the low-temperature (150–400°C) hydrolysis and transformation of ultramafic rocks produces hydrogen gas \\((H_{2})\\). The hydrogen gas thus produced reacts with simple oxidized carbon compounds, such as carbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\)) and carbon monoxide (\\(CO\\)), under reducing conditions to release methane gas \\((CH_{4})\\) and other organic molecules through Fischer–Tropsch-type synthesis. The gas produced can be used by underground microbes to gain metabolic energy but the size of these reserves and their impact are not yet understood. The continual and elevated production of hydrogen is capable of reducing carbon, thus initiating an inorganic pathway to produce organic compounds, particularly methane. Production of \\(H_{2}\\) and \\(H_{2}\\)-dependent \\(CH_{4}\\) in serpentinization systems has received significant interdisciplinary interest, especially with regard to the abiotic synthesis of organic compounds and the origins and maintenance of life in Earth’s lithosphere (the rocky outer part of the Earth) and elsewhere in the universe. Serpentinization is a weathering process in which ultramafic rocks react with water, generating a range of products, including serpentine and other minerals, in addition to \\(H_{2}\\) and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that are capable of sustaining microbial life. This process can be defined as a hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks that occurs in a variety of tectonic settings on Earth such as the ocean floor, mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones. Photolysis This process includes using light to break water into hydrogen and oxygen. The biophotolysis includes using sunlight and specialised microorganisms such as green algae to split water and produce oxygen. Direct photolysis receives energy from very energetic photons such as UV lights. It is one of the most important reactions on Earth as it is the source of almost all the molecular oxygen present in the atmosphere. Radiolysis Radiolysis consists in a series of phenomena by which molecules are destabilized by ionizing irradiation particles such as phonons, electrons or heavy ions, leading to new chemical species. Water radiolysis is the decomposition of water molecules by ionizing radiation produced during the decay of radioactive elements. Hydrogen \\((H_{2})\\) is produced in geological settings by dissociation of water due to radiation from radioactive decay of naturally occurring uranium (\\(^{238}U, ^{235}U)\\), thorium (\\(^{232}Th\\)) and potassium (\\(^{40}K)\\). Radiolysis occurs in deep-sea sediments (in underwater basalt where both water and radiation are present) where it provides molecular hydrogen which thus supports the microbial community as an electron donor. Many organisms catabolically utilize \\(H_{2}\\), including methanogens, sulfate-reducers, iron reducers, and nitrate reducers. There is evidence that some of these organisms, specifically sulfate reducers and methanogens, are active in subseafloor basalt. Radiolysis undoubtedly occurs in subseafloor basalt, as both water and radiation are present. Magma Degassing This phenomenon refers to the separation or exsolution of gases and volatile components dissolved in the magma and their dispersion in the atmosphere. This occurs through the nucleation, growth and coalescence of gas bubbles. Degassing occurs both from craters and from soils and/or hydrothermal events. It occurs both during volcanic eruptions and in quiescent phases. Fermentation Fermentative hydrogen production is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen manifested by a diverse group of bacteria using multienzyme systems involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark Fermentation does not require solar energy and everything starts from the oxidation of organic compounds. Photofermentation occurs in the presence of light which is used to break down organic matter, releasing hydrogen.  Thermal Escape Atmospheric escape is the process by which the atmosphere of a planetary body loses gas into outer space. Since hydrogen is the lightest element, it has a higher average speed than the other elements and, for this reason, it will escape from the atmosphere more easily.

In this technique, DNA and RNA molecules are separated by applying an electric field that moves the negatively charged nucleic acids through a matrix of: Agarose, which is extracted from seaweed, is appropriate for separating DNA fragments ranging in size from a few hundred base pairs to about 20 kb. Polyacrylamide is preferred for proteins and smaller DNA fragments. In general, the gel matrix acts like a sieve, allowing shorter molecules to move more quickly through the pores of the gel than longer molecules. The equipment and supplies for conducting agarose gel electrophoresis in DNA studies include electrophoresis chamber and power supply, gel casting trays, sample combs, electrophoresis buffer, loading buffer, ethidium bromide (EtBr), and transilluminator.  One method of staining DNA is to expose it to the dye EtBr. EtBr intercalates between the stacked bases of nucleic acids and fluoresces red–orange when illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) light. EtBr should be handled with care for its toxic and mutagenic nature; this is the reason why, it is substituted by other dyes like Sybr Green. Agarose gels are cast by melting the agarose powder dissolved in a specific buffer until a clear, transparent solution is achieved. The melted gel is then poured on a tray and allowed to solidify. Upon solidification, the DNA samples are loaded into the sample wells and gel is run at a voltage and for a time period that will perform optimal separation. One well is reserved for a DNA ladder, a standard reference that contains DNA fragments of known lengths. When an electric field is applied across the gel, DNA migrates toward the anode. A well-defined “line” of DNA on a gel is called a band. Each band contains a large number of DNA fragments of the same size that have all traveled as a group to the same location. By comparing the bands of a sample to the DNA ladder, we can determine its approximate size. For linear fragments of DNA and/or RNA the migration distance is inversely proportional to the size of the molecule (i.e. its length in bases). Single-stranded nucleic acids (like RNA) tend to form complex secondary structures, so their “electrophoretic pathway” is strongly influenced by how they fold. Before being separated by electrophoresis, RNA must be denatured to keep the molecules in linear shape. Commonly used denaturing agents: heat, formaldehyde, formamide, urea. 7.3 PCR Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique for exponential ampliﬁcation of a fragment of DNA, using a heat-stable DNA polymerase and an automated heat block that is capable of rapid changes of temperature, inducing the enzymatic synthesis of millions of copies of a specific DNA segment. It can be schematized in different steps: First stage: The template DNA molecule is initially denatured to two single strands by heating to high temperature (typically 90–95 °C). Two small oligonucleotides that are complementary to sequences on opposite strands of the template molecule are used as primers, allowing the binding for the DNA polymerase. Second stage: the single-stranded oligonucleotide primers anneal to the denatured template molecule, during a cooling phase. Third stage: the new strand extends from the annealed primer in a 5’-3’ direction by the heat-stable polymerase. This is performed at the optimum temperature for the polymerase (68–72 °C). The most commonly used polymerase is the enzyme isolated from Thermus aquaticus (Taq DNA polymerase). After the ﬁrst cycle, each template molecule has been ampliﬁed to two molecules. These in turn are denatured in the next cycle and ampliﬁed to produce four molecules. The four molecules are ampliﬁed to eight in the third cycle, and so on. Each successive cycle effectively doubles the amount of DNA product. The three-stage cycle of denaturation, annealing, and primer extension is repeated 25–40 times in a typical PCR procedure. PCR products are visualized by electrophoresis gel technique followed by staining with ﬂuorescent dyes or by hybridization to labeled oligonucleotide probes. Species specific primers are used. The most used sequence is rRNA that includes the gene for 16S rRNA. The reagents that are used are: Buffer Tris-HCl: keeps the pH stable in order to generate an environment suitable for the reaction. Primers: single-stranded oligonucleotides of approximately 18-25 bases that allow the reaction to be started. The primers are complementary, one at the 3’ end and the other at the 5’ end of the DNA segment you want to amplify. In particular, the forward primer will bind to the 3’-5’ antiparallel strand, delimiting the beginning of the synthesis, while the reverse primer will bind to the other strand, delimiting the end of the synthesis. \\(MgCl_{2}\\): Cofactor of Taq DNA polymerase that influences primer hybridization. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs-dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP): they are necessary for the synthesis of new strands. Taq DNA polymerase: heat-stable polymerase.

The extremely cold climate in both Arctic and Antarctic regions is basically related to the following factors: There is an undersupply of solar energy throughout both the Arctic and the Antarctic, compared to other parts of the world, because of the low angle of arriving sunlight, the slope of the Earth’s axis, and the orbit of this planet around the sun. The wind circulation around the world, caused by the differential heating between the poles and the equator as well as the rotation of Earth (Coriolis effect), acts as shields for preventing tropical heat from reaching the Arctic and Antarctic. Due to the high albedo of white snow and ice covers, the Earth’s surface in both Arctic and Antarctic reflects a large proportion of incoming solar radiation, and thus, amplifies cooling conditions in a positive feedback. Humidity, the capacity of air to hold water vapor, is basically very low due to the extremely cold climate conditions. Soils across the polar regions harbor diverse microorganisms, which dominate the biogeochemical cycling. However, polar soil microbial diversity is largely underrepresented, and has not been directly compared with the non-polar regions at a global scale, which hinders our understanding of the potential importance of polar microbial diversity. Soil microorganisms are fundamental components of polar ecosystems, where plants and 58 animals are greatly limited by the harsh environments. Microorganisms are dominant drivers of biogeochemical cycles, and influence both climate change and ecosystem functions in polar regions. The microorganisms in the three poles are subjected to high levels of abiotic stresses, including yearly low temperatures, low water availability (in some polar soils) and extreme UV radiation fluxes, which are substantially distinct from the non-polar regions. 8.2 Cold seeps and mud volcanoes Cold seeps are the areas of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occur. Such seeps occur over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity. Fluid seepage out of those fissures gets diffused by sediment, and emerges over an area several hundred meters wide. Cold seeps constitute a biome supporting several endemic species of animals and plants. These seeps develop unique topography over time, where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs. These reactions may also be dependent on bacterial activity. Finding and understanding cold seeps is important because they have global significance for the transfer of methane carbon from long-term storage in ocean-floor sediments into the ocean and atmosphere. Released methane is often oxidized to carbon dioxide, leading to changes in ocean chemistry, such as ocean acidification. 8.3 Shallow water-hydrothermal vents Geothermal system are extreme environments characterized by high temperatures, a low pH, and high gas emissions, of which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide \\((CO^{2})\\) is dominant. Additionally, several reduced gases are emitted in variable concentrations, including hydrogen sulfide \\((H_{2}S)\\), hydrogen \\((H_{2})\\), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia \\((NH_{3})\\), and the potent greenhouse gas methane \\((CH_{4})\\). These gases are the driving force for the formation of a predominantly chemolithoautotrophic microbial community. Besides \\((CH_{4})\\), \\(H_{2}\\) is an abundant gas in volcanic and geothermal ecosystems that can be used by members of the microbial community as an electron donor. The low \\(O_{2}\\) concentrations within these soils facilitate microaerobic \\(H_{2}\\) oxidation using oxygensensitive hydrogenases. Localized spots without any \\(O_{2}\\) could give rise to anaerobic \\(H_{2}\\) consumption, for example, by autotrophic sulfate-reducing microorganisms or hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Methanogens are often detected in volcanic/geothermal environments, especially in the deeper anaerobic layers of the soil. Geothermal ecosystems are low in organic carbon, but \\(CO_{2}\\) is highly available and can be assimilated into biomass by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Shallow-water hydrothermal vents (&lt;200 m in depth) have a widespread biogeographical distribution, generally associated with active submarine volcanism. In these areas, the presence of deep seated magma and deep faults, caused by tectonic activity, drives hydrothermal fluids circulation. Hydrothermal fluids are emitted from vents, which represent an opening through Earth’s crust. Because of their proximity to the surface, shallow-water hydrothermal systems are influenced both by geothermally generated reducing power and by light, and can be described as “high energy” environments, where microbial metabolism is fueled by different energy sources.  Another potential source of heat that can drive hydrothermal circulation is exothermal geochemical (weathering) reactions (e.g., serpentinization). For each of these hydrothermal systems, resulting vent fluids are often highly enriched in reducing inorganic chemical species (electron donors) which, when mixed with oxidized seawater (with abundant electron acceptors), can generate aqueous solutions with multiple redox disequilibria readily exploited by archaeal and bacterial microbial communities. They are characterized by a fluid temperature range of 10–119◦C. Many shallow-water hydrothermal vents show high concentrations of compounds and metal elements involved in biogeochemical cycles, including carbon, sulphur, methane, and iron. Due to these extreme conditions, shallow-water vents are outstanding environments to investigate the diversity of microorganisms involved in organic matter synthesis, breakdown or mineralization, metal cycles and interactions with fauna. 8.4 Hot-springs, fumaroles and mud volcanoes Hydrothermal vents, or hot springs, are areas where geothermally heated water discharges through a planet’s crust onto the surface, either subaerially or subaqueously. They occur in areas where there is an adequate heat source to drive fluid circulation. On Earth, this heat is primarily derived from tectonic activity near plate boundaries, either through magma generation or faulting. Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) are an important natural source of methane emission. Mud volcanoes (MVs) are prominent surface expressions in compressional tectonic regimes. Often, methane with \\(CO_{2}\\) and minor amounts of \\(C^{2+}\\) hydrocarbons constitute the emitted phase. The quantity of methane emission is primarily controlled by in situ microbial production and consumption near the surface. Methane is either directly released into the atmosphere or oxidized with electron acceptors within sediments or from surface (e.g., oxygen, sulfate, or metal oxides). Most terrestrial MVs are characterized by a limited availability of sulfate (&lt;1 mM). Such a low quantity of sulfate would increase the free energy (less negative) and drive sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) less energetically favorable. A fumarole is an opening in the crust of the Earth and is often found in areas surrounding volcanoes, which emits steam (forms when superheated water vaporizes as its pressure drops when it emerges from the ground) and gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Cracks present in actively degassing geothermal soils are of great importance since gas is often pressure-driven, contrary to non-geothermal soil where gas movements are generally only driven by concentration gradients. Gas flow is, therefore, often focused in small areas, sometimes becoming open vents, known as fumaroles, where hydrothermal gases are directly released into the atmosphere. The gases themselves interact and modify the soil, and the most effective agents are temperature and pH. Kinetic/thermal energy allows them to flow up and rules the gas-water-rock interactions. Due to these interactions, during their ascent to the surface, the volcanic/geothermal gases are depleted in some species (such as \\(SO_{2})\\) and enriched in others (such as \\(CH_{4}\\) and \\(H_{2}S\\)). 8.5 Hyperacidic lakes and volcanoes Hyperacidic volcanic lakes are some of the most extreme geochemical environments in the present day earth’s crust. They provide a trace of the true scale of heat and mass transfer in active volcanoes and are implicated in their collapse and eruption histories. The escape of high-temperature gases from intrusions provides the heat and many of the raw materials for the chemistry of lakes hosted by active volcanic systems. The gas mixture released by crystallizing magmas is dominated by water (85–95 mol %) with the remainder made up of carbon dioxide \\((CO_{2}\\)) and sulfur dioxide \\((SO_{2})\\), and lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen sulfide \\((H_{2}S)\\), hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen \\((H_{2})\\), and other gases. Most of the heat transferred by this gas mixture is due to the large water component while the acidic gases (\\(SO_{2}\\) and HCl) are primarily responsible for the distinctive chemistry of acidic lakes. Condensation of gas mixtures near the surface and on entry into a cool lake basin results in the formation of acidic lake water. Sulfur dioxide gas reacts with water to form sulfuric acid \\((H_{2}SO_{4})\\) and hydrogen sulfide \\((H_{2}S)\\) through a simple reaction such as: \\(4SO_{2} + 4H_{2}O = 3H_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}S\\) The acid thus formed reacts aggressively with rocks below and around the lake and is responsible for the suspended burden of amorphous silica, sulfur, and anatase (titanium oxide, \\(TiO_{2})\\) particles that give rise to spectacular lake coloration. Geological associations lead to the widely accepted explanation that acidic volcanic lakes are a ‘cold trap’ for expanding magmatic gas, that, close by, is otherwise expressed as active, high temperature fumaroles and extensive rock alteration (solfatara), and by ash and gas plumes from more active volcanoes. Hyperacidic volcanic lakes are expressions of much larger scale magmatic gas expansion inside volcanoes from source to surface. Their temperature and acidity are sustained by the capture of heat and \\(SO_{2}\\) (and HCl) and a suite of metals and metalloids, including Cu, Fe, As, Au, Bi, Se, Te, and Sb, from the magmatic gas. These lakes, together with high temperature fumaroles, therefore provide clues about the physics and chemistry of high temperature gas flow at the volcano scale that otherwise are inaccessible to direct observation. 8.6 Deserts and arid environments Deserts (arid lands/drylands) constitute about 35% of the land areas of the world and are typically characterized by rainfall scarcity, higher temperatures and evapotranspiration, lower humidity, and a general paucity of vegetation cover. Arid environments are defined by the lack of water availability, which is directly related to the mean annual precipitation (MAP), and high values of solar irradiation, which impacts the community composition of animals, plants, and the microbial structure of the soil. In the soil microbiome, bacteria are the most abundant and diverse organisms, and their presence is crucial for plant growth. As arid environments display scarce vegetation, the presence and abundance of bacteria are essential for nutrient cycling and carbon storage. 8.7 Acid mine drainage Acid mine drainage (AMD) or acid metalliferous drainage is the wastewater resulting from mining activities. It has been considered as a pollutant of serious concern because of its acidic nature, high content of toxic metal ions (Fe, Zn, Cd, Al, Cu, Pb), dissolved anions (sulfates, nitrates, chlorides, arsenates, etc.), hardness, and suspended solids. The pH of AMD ranges around 2–4. The sulfate concentration ranges from 100 to 5000 mg/L\\(^{−1}\\). Metal-rich mine wastewater is generated due to accelerated oxidation of iron pyrite \\((FeS_{2})\\) and other sulfide minerals during mining activities. AMD exerts negative effects on the environment by: adding metals to aquatic ecosystems; altering water chemistry; decreasing the amount of oxygen available for aquatic organisms; precipitation of metals (ferric hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide etc.), leading to reduced availability of light to aquatic ecosystems; changing water quality. Acidic nature of AMD destroys vegetation, accelerates soil erosion, and increases the susceptibility of aquatic animals to disease. Because of these environmental concerns AMD needs to be treated before release in the environment. 8.8 Deep-sea anoxic lakes and brines Deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) are unique water bodies occurring within fractures at the bottom of the sea, originated from the re-dissolution of evaporitic deposits buried under layers of sediments and exposed to seawater because of tectonic activity. This re-dissolution process generates the DHABs and a gradient of salinity, the brine-seawater interface (BSI), at the boundary between the hypersaline water mass and seawater. Such a salinity gradient is a halocline where the salt dissolution increases the water density determining a pycnocline. In parallel to the gradient of salinity and density a chemocline occurs with gradients of the many chemical species that form redox couples capable of supporting different microbial metabolisms. DHABs have been described in the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Red Sea. Due to the high density, these brine pools hardly mix with the overlying deep seawater, and are often considered as lakes at the bottom of the sea. 8.9 Deep-sea hydrothermal vents Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are regions of the sea floor at which hot, anoxic, chemical-rich water is released into the cold, oxic, deep ocean. Hydrothermal vents are formed when seawater percolates through cracks in the ocean crust into the subsurface. During this process, the water heats up and reacts with hot rocks, enriching it with a variety of chemicals and volatile gases. This buoyant hydrothermal fluid rises and emerges from orifices in the sea floor, rapidly mixing with cold seawater and providing a redox interface at which chemical sources of energy support vent ecosystems. In contrast to most ecosystems, which are fuelled by photosynthesis, vent communities depend on chemosynthesis. Vent microorganisms, including animal symbionts, members of microbial mats and free- living cells, use the energy produced by oxidation of sulfur, hydrogen, methane and iron to fix carbon. In turn, this organic carbon supports dense animal communities largely through symbiotic relationships with bacteria but also via grazing or suspension feeding and subsequent trophic transfer. Fluids emerging from vents carry reduced chemical species (for example, hydrogen sulfide, \\(Fe_{2+},\\) hydrogen gas and methane) that are electron sources for chemolithoautotrophic growth. Vent fluids range from acidic to highly alkaline, not only demanding capacity for pH homeostasis but also shaping the availability of dissolved inorganic carbon (concentrations are higher at lower pH), which is required in excess for the rapid chemoautotrophic growth exhibited by bacteria–animal consortia such as the giant tubeworm Riftia pachyptila. Hot, acidic fluids often hold sufficient carbon dioxide, which is obtained directly by animals, whereas carbon dioxide may be limiting in cold, neutral or basic fluids, thus requiring mechanisms for carbon uptake and concentration. Hydrothermal fluids also contain several toxic compounds, such as heavy metals (copper, cadmium and lead) and hydrogen sulfide, that require specific adaptations. 8.10 Serpentinizing environments The Earth’s subsurface is predicted to be an expansive habitat for microorganisms. Unlike surface biomes, the subsurface is largely decoupled from photosynthetic primary production; instead, many subsurface ecosystems are influenced by carbon and energy liberated from the Earth’s mantle and crust. However, given the inherent lack of accessibility, direct sampling of subsurface, rock-hosted environments has been limited. Serpentinization is a globally relevant subsurface process caused by the hydration of iron and magnesium rich minerals within the Earth’s crust which subsequently releases hydrogen gas. The hydrogen produced, in addition to other reduced compounds generated, can serve as the energetic basis for microbial food webs. Serpentinization is a widespread geochemical process associated with aqueous alteration of ultramafic rocks that produces abundant reductants \\((H_{2}\\) and \\(CH_{4})\\) for life to exploit, but also potentially challenging conditions, including high pH, limited availability of terminal electron acceptors, and low concentrations of inorganic carbon. As a consequence, past studies of serpentinites have reported low cellular abundances and limited microbial diversity. Serpentinization is a widespread geochemical process involving the aqueous alteration of peridotite to serpentine minerals, resulting in an abundance of potential reductants, in the form of hydrogen, methane, and small organic molecules. Serpentinization also releases hydroxyl ions, which creates extremely high pH fluids (pH &gt; 10). At high pH, bicarbonate and carbonate are the dominant species of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the latter can precipitate out of solution as carbonate minerals when in the presence of divalent cations, such as \\(Ca^{2+}\\) and \\(Mg^{2+}\\) commonly found in serpentinite fluids. Thus, fluids associated with serpentinization are characteristically low in DIC, particularly dissolved \\(CO_{2}\\). Compared to the abundance of reductants in these systems, there is a lack of corresponding oxidants, which likely limits the range of potential microbial metabolisms. Thus subsurface serpentinite environments are characterised by unusual challenges to life, such as extreme pH (&gt;10), limited availability of dissolved carbon, and a lack of potential terminal electron acceptors. 8.11 Deep-sea sediments and trenches Deep-sea environments compose the largest habitat on Earth and are a major carbon sink on the planet. Even though they present harsh environmental conditions, such as low temperatures (-1 to 4°C), high hydrostatic pressure, absence of solar radiation, and low supply of organic matter, these environments harbour microbial assemblages with high genetic and metabolic diversity. A third of the total Bacteria and Archaea cells on Earth are located in the deep oceanic subsurface and 4% are in the upper 10–50 cm of oceanic sediments. Microbes play a vital role in deep-sea environments, driving a wide range of processes, including those related to biogeochemical cycles, organic matter remineralization, and primary production by chemosynthetic organisms. In these environments, most of the total microbial cell biomass appears to be composed of bacteria, although it may change towards anoxic subsurfaces, where archaea can dominate. 8.12 Soda lakes and hypersaline lakes Soda lakes and soda deserts are naturally occurring alkaline environments. They represent the most stable high-pH environments on Earth, where large amounts of carbonate minerals can generate pH values of 11.5. Although these environments are widely distributed, they are often located in inaccessible continental interiors. The conditions necessary for the formation of a soda lake have much in common with those for the generation of an athalassohaline salt lake, but with the major difference that in a soda lake carbonate (or carbonate complexes) becomes the major anion in solution. The most important contributing factor is a lack of alkaline earth cations \\((Ca^{2+}\\) and \\(Mg^{2+})\\) in the surrounding topography, which essentially means an absence of rocks of sedimentary origin. Further circumstances include a shallow depression forming a closed drainage basin with a high marginal relief, having sufficient rainfall to sustain streams entering the basin to produce a standing body of water. In arid zones with high rates of evaporation exceeding inflow, salts accumulate by evaporative concentration. One of the noticeable features of many soda lakes is their colour. The water may be various shades of green or red because of the massive blooms of microorganisms. This colouring is a reflection of the very high primary productivity associated with these lakes. The almost unlimited supply of \\(CO_{2}\\) combined with high ambient temperatures and high daily light intensities in the tropics contribute to making the East African soda lakes among the most productive of the naturally occurring aquatic environments in the world. The photosynthetic primary productivity, mainly the result of the dense populations of cyanobacteria, presumably supports the rest of the microbial community. In contrast to aerobic habitats, the anaerobic alkaline environment has received little attention. Because these are very productive environments with a concomitant shortage of dissolved \\(O_{2}\\), anaerobic processes are bound to play a significant role. Hypersaline ecosystems are widely distributed habitats including a variety of terrestrial lakes and deep-sea basins with salt concentrations exceeding three times seawater up to saturation. In addition to being hypersaline, these ecosystems are often characterized by other extremes in environmental conditions such as high alkalinity, low oxygen concentration and high UV irradiation. Hypersaline habitats can be divided into two main types, thalassohaline- and athalassohaline waters. Thalassohaline waters or brines are of marine origin and have an ionic composition similar to that of seawater, with sodium chloride as the predominant salt and are often found in close proximity to seas and oceans. These include industrial solar salterns and natural shallow basins that became detached from the sea or ocean. Athalassohaline waters or brines such as the Dead Sea and soda lakes are often found inland and therefore not directly connected to marine waters. These brines are shaped by the dissolution of mineral salt deposits of continental origin, which are dominated by potassium-, magnesium-, sodium- and carbonate ions. Although high salinity is generally considered lethal for most organisms, hypersaline environments are often teeming with life and can harbor high biomass of functional and taxonomical diverse communities. 8.13 Nuclear contaminated sites In the past decade, uranium mining, military activities and nuclear power plant accidents have introduced anthropogenic radioactive contaminants into the environment. Due to their intrinsic properties (i.e. radioactive decay half-life, volatility and mobility), most of these radionuclides (RNs) are highly persistent in the terrestrial environment. Radiations emitted by RNs present either in the environment or accumulated inside organisms are able to ionize atoms or molecules, with potential consequent damage to living cells. Level of such biological detriment is linked to the energy deposited into organisms exposed to ionizing radiation, under the consensual assumption of additive effects. Soil microorganisms and RNs display complex relationships with each other. On the one hand, bacteria can interact with RNs via multiple mechanisms including bioreduction, biomineralization, bioaccumulation or biosorption. On the other hand, RNs may exert radio- and chemotoxic effects on bacteria, thus influencing the structure and activity of microbial communities.

It is the most studied gene for microbial phylogeny; it is one of the components of the lower subunit of the bacterial ribosome. The gene, that codes for 16S RNA (component of the small subunit of the bacterial ribosome), is approximately 1,500 bp long. A 2-3% change in nucleotide sequence (30-45 bp) is considered indicative of a different species. The approach of building phylogenetic trees based on 16S sequence alignment is the most widespread and was used for the first time in 1977 by Carl Woese to distinguish the domain of Archaea from that of Bacteria. 10.2 Shotgun metagenomic analysis High-throughput sequencing approaches enable genomic analyses ideally of all microbes in a sample, not just those that are amenable to cultivation. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing allows researchers to comprehensively sample all genes from all organisms in a given complex sample. The method allows microbiologists to evaluate bacterial and metabolic diversity and detect the abundance of microbes in various environments. A typical shotgun metagenomics study comprises five steps, after the initial study design: the collection, processing and sequencing of the samples; preprocessing of the sequencing reads; sequence analysis to profile taxonomic, functional and genomic features of the microbiome; statistical and biological post-processing analysis; validation. 10.3 Pipelines "],["statistic.html", "Chapter 11 Statistic 11.1 Mean 11.2 Median 11.3 Standard Deviations 11.4 Variance 11.5 P-Value 11.6 T-Test 11.7 Anova test", " Chapter 11 Statistic 11.1 Mean 11.2 Median 11.3 Standard Deviations 11.4 Variance 11.5 P-Value 11.6 T-Test 11.7 Anova test "],["geology.html", "Chapter 12 Geology 12.1 Plate Tectonics 12.2 Subduction zones", " Chapter 12 Geology 12.1 Plate Tectonics Plate tectonics refers to a particular mode of convection in a planetary mantle, which is made of silicate rocks, and so far it is observed only on Earth. Earth’s surface is divided into a various plates that are moving at different velocities. The interaction between the plate boundaries cause most geological activities, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruption, and mountain building. 12.2 Subduction zones Subductions zones are a dynamic site of mass and energy exchange between the asthenosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, with significant implications for the evolution of the Earth’s surface and interior. In subduction zones, lithospheric plates are descending into the mantle, giving rise to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and concentrations of economic ores. Subduction’s delivery of crustal materials to the mantle means that it plays a primary role in cycling of terrestrial elements. On a larger scale, subduction drives plate tectonics, as plate movement is chiefly driven by the downward pull of oceanic slabs sinking into the asthenospheric mantle. Subduction generates strong thermal and chemical disequilibrium, leading to dehydration and hydration, mineral transformations, and partial melting of crustal and mantle rocks. This results in different types of subduction zone processes such as metamorphism, metasomatism and magmatism. Understanding these three types of geological processes is essential to the geochemical transfer from the subducting crust into the mantle. Crustal recycling at convergent plate boundaries has been accepted as the fundamental mechanism for geochemical heterogeneity of the mantle. "],["polygons-plot.html", "Chapter 13 Polygons Plot", " Chapter 13 Polygons Plot Written by: Donato Giovannelli In case you have not had enough plot and chart types, here come a new one: the Polygon plot. A Polygon plot [singular, Polygons plot, plural] is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. I have developed the concept for the polygons plot in late 2018 while working on our review Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context, published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology. While working on the review, I started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earth’s life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. I wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born! The first polygons plot appeared in Merino et al. 2019 Frontiers in Microbiology. If you find the plot interesting or useful, consider citing the Merino et al. 2019 paper. More information about how to cite the Polygon plot are available at the section how to cite 13.0.1 Polygon plot features Polygon plot have many features that makes them unique and convenient to show multivariate ranges and a number of statistical properties. It is possible to plot from 3 to 6 variable in a single 2D plot (potentially more, depending of big your final plot will be) The showed range can be the interval minimum-maximum, interquartile range or any other interval You can add the mean (arithmetic, geometric, etc…) as a single line running through the plot You can easily use the shape of the polygon plot to categorize you observations into discrete groups having a similar multivariate distribution of the ranges for the selected variables Soon(ish) you’ll be able to plot the boxplot or density plot on the outside of each axis You can use the perimeter of the axis projection or the area of the polygon to sort you polygons plot array or query your visualization based on extension of the range of variables visualized A word of caution: While it defines a space on a plane that can be used for algebraic operations to work on a series of plots (called a polygons plot array), it does not define the state space of the possible combinations of the visualized variables. Visualizing the polygon plot as the state space of possible instances might seem like an intuitive thing to do, but it is inherently wrong! You are have been warned! We are working on a R package to be able to make Polygons plot easily and add some of the functionalities we have imagined discussing these plots with Shaunna Morrison, Fang Huang and Anirudh Prabhu. For now, we have a beta Shiny app built by Fang Huang than can be used right now to create Polygons plot and download them as .png or .svg. You can find the beta of the app here: fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/. Fun fact! My friends refer to these plots as “Donato’s plots”! Keep reading to find out how to use and read polygons plot, how they were invented and how they stack against other popular choices for plotting multivariate data. Or just jump ahead to the section you are most interest in! The inception Reading the Polygon plot Using the Polygon plot: the Shiny app Polygons plot array List of future features How to cite the Polygon plot Questions, support and contribute! Gallery of Polygons 13.0.2 The inception While working on the review I started trying to put on the same plot multiple ranges of variables. The first choice was to use multiple boxplots. But while they are very robust and well known, it was difficult to portray the kind of information I was looking for. Boxplot had to be grouped by variable, making across variable comparison difficult, or by group, making across group comparison difficult. A lot of boxplots were required to put all the variable together, with way to much ink on the page. Messy. I did not like it. My planetary and life data used for the Merino et al. 2019 paper visualized as a boxplots. Searching the web I found forest plot, which in essence are a simplified form of bloxplot were the range is represented by a single line. The result is a series of parallel line (thus reducing the amount of ink, but also the amount of information reported) essentially suffering the same problems of the boxplot. &gt;The same data as above visualized as a Forest plot. The type of comparison I was looking for was similar to the information displayed by a spider chart (called also polar chart, radar chart or star plot among many other names). While not one of my favorite, spider chart are useful to visualize multivariate data in a single plot, and give more intuitive comparison of the distribution of the data among different variables between different plots. The problem arises when for each variable you don’t want just to plot a single value, but you want to show the data range (like minimum and maximum), or a combination of range and average. &gt;The same data as above plotted as spider plots plot. Ranges are difficult to visualize and sometimes impossible to plot, depending on the variable’s order. I started doodling through a series of option, and devising a series of rules. Soon I started converging on the idea that polygons were the best solution to visualize ranges for n-variables. 13.0.3 Reading the Polygon plot Reading a polygon plot is easy. The plot has 3 to 6 axis representing the different variables to be visualized. The range (for example minimum-maximum values) are plotted as a segment parallel to its corresponding axis. The different segments are linked together to form a polygon. The resulting polygon might have up to 2x the variable number. This is due to an arbitrary space inserted between the different axis to improve readability and avoid plotting artifacts (called offset). Single values are plotted as a point (vertex), while missing value are represented by a missing edge on the data polygon. The multivariate space is defined by the resulting polygon. The mean for each variable can be represented by a single point and connected by a line. A word of caution: The multivariate space defined in the 2D plane by the polygon plot does not define the state space of the possible combinations of the visualized variables. Thinking of the polygon plot as the state space of possible instances might seem like an intuitive thing to do, but it is inherently wrong! You are have been warned! &gt;Anatomy of a polygon plot, with all the main characteristic explained. 13.0.4 Using the Polygon plots: the Shiny app While we are working toward a R package to be able to use polygon plots and their functionalities (Help us by contributing!), Fang Huang has built a Shiny app than can be used to create Polygons plot. The resulting plots can be download as .png or .svg. You can find the beta of the app here: fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/. Data can be provided as .csv file to the app in one of three ways (also mixing them in the same data file): Table of the formats that can be provided to the polygon plot app |–|–|–|–| You can find an example of the format in the app. Once you have uploaded the data file you can progress to step 2 and make you polygon plot. The Shiny app allows you to make only one plot at the time, but it has a nice number of functionalities. You can selected the variable number, you can select the offset, map different variables to the axis of your choice and vary aesthetics of the plot. Once you are done download the plot in your favorite format! 13.0.5 Polygons plot array Combining more than one polygon plot will give you what we call a polygons plot array. So far we have been using this term to refer to polygons plot that have 6+ plots, but this is totally arbitrary. Polygons plot array give you an excellent way to compare the range of a multivariate space across different sample/sites/observations very quickly. Our brain is very good in distinguishing different shapes, and pattern can be recognized quickly. &gt; An example of a polygons plot array sorted by area of the polygon. In polygons plot array the only rule to make it worthwhile is to keep the order, type, number and scale of the variables constant across all the different plots. Once you have the array you can potentially ask (and will be able to in the R package) questions based on simple geometric calculations. For example you can sort your plots based on the perimeter or the area of the polygon. You can use skewness or symmetries to sort your plots. We think in the future we will use image recognition to identify specific characteristics of the plot to classify it in the multivariate space. 13.0.6 List of future features Here an overgrowing list of possible features to be included in the R packages we are developing. We periodically update the list based on the feature request on GitHub, but head there for complete list. Also, consider contributing if you know how to code!
