The mixtures can be separated in different ways: Filtration: is a method used to separate solid components from liquid or gaseous substances. Centrifuge: is a method used to separate solid substances from the liquids, exploiting the centrifuge force. In this way, the solid particles settle on the bottom whereas the liquid substance remains in the upper portion; this liquid phase is called supernatant. Decantation: is a process for separating mixtures by removing a precipitate-free liquid layer or settled solids from a solution, based on gravity. The aim may be to obtain a decanted liquid (particulate-free liquid) or to recover the precipitate. For the preparation of a solution, some aspects have to be considered. For example, solute solubility has to be known because some problems can occur for the saturation of solution. Moreover, it should be careful that the solute is well dissolved in the solvent. When the solution is clear, it has to be filtered to avoid any kind of microbial contamination: in most cases, the solution is sterilised through filtration using filters 0.22 µm: sometimes, autoclave is used to sterilise a solution depending on the kind of solute present into. Another question is correlated to the use of plastic cylinder or glass ones, depending on the temperature used for dissolving (room temperature or high temperature) or on the requirement for the metal-free solution. 2.2 Solubility The solubility indicates the quantity of a solute dissolved in a solvent. The solubility may be expressed by using different unite of measures indicating the concentration of a solution: ppm is the acronym of “parts per millions”, and it can be also expressed in milligrams per Liter (mg/L); it corresponds to 1 µg/mL. This unit of measure indicates how many milligrams of a solute are present in 1 liter of solution. ppt is the acronym of “parts per thousands” - and it can be also expressed in milligrams per 100 mL (mg/100 mL); it corresponds to 1 µg/mL. This unit of measure indicates how many milligrams of a solute are present in 100 milliliters of solution. ppb is the acronym of “parts per billions” - and it can be also expressed in micrograms per Liter (ug/L). This unit of measure indicates how many micrograms of a solute are present in 1 liter of solution. Concentration (w/w): corresponds to weight of a solute in 100 mg of solution Concentration (V/V): corresponds to volume of a solute in 100 mL of solution Concentration (w/V): corresponds to weight of a solute in 100 mL of solution Molarity (M = mol/L): corresponds to number of moles of solute in 1 L of solution. The solubility of most solid substances is affected by the temperature: if the temperature increases, the solubility increases. The solubility of gas has a different behaviour: if the temperature increases, the solubility decreases. 2.3 Temperature Temperature is a physical quantity that is a measure of hotness or coldness of matter or radiation. Temperature is measured with a thermometer. The most common scales are the Celsius scale (with the unit °C), the Fahrenheit scale (with the unit °F), and the Kelvin scale (with the unit K). Conversion between the temperature scales (add TABLE) 2.4 pH and pOH - pondus Hydrogenium and pondus OH In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. pH = \\(-log_{10}[H^{+}]\\) The pOH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. pOH = \\(-log_{10}[OH^{-}]\\) At 25°C (77°F), solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH higher than 7 are basic. Solutions with a pH of 7 at this temperature are neutral (for example pure water, in which there is the same concentration of \\(H^{+}\\) ions as \\(OH^{-}\\) ions). To calculate the concentration of \\(H^{+}\\) or \\(OH^{-}\\) in a sample with a specific pH/pOH value: \\([H^{+}]\\) = \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\([OH^{-}]\\) = \\(10^{-pOH}\\) The pH is inversely proportional to the temperature of the solution. When the temperature of a solution increases, molecular vibrations in the solution increase causing ionization and the formation of \\(H^{+}\\) ions. More \\(H^{+}\\) ions lead to more acidic behaviour. Due to temperature changes, the pH value of the solution changes. Therefore, pH decreases as temperature increases. The pH is measured with a pHmeter. If the pHmeter has the temperature probe, the pH value is calculated considering the probable changes due to temperature. If the pHmeter has not the temperature probe, the real pH value should be calculated with a pH temperature correction calculator. The pH value is an important variable, since it can control biological or chemical processes, the availability of nutrients or even the activity of microorganisms. 2.5 MVpH - MilliVolt pH The pH probe is generally a glass electrode that measures the difference in electrical potential on two sides of a thin glass membrane placed at the end of the electrode; this potential difference is linked to the difference between the concentrations of hydrogen ions at the inside and outside the membrane. A standard pH sensor outputs a millivolt (mV) signal, which corresponds to a pH value. Moving one pH unit along the scale in any direction will correspond to a change in voltage of 59 mV. - An output of 0 mV is equal to pH 7. - An output, included between 0 and -414.12 mV (7 x -59 mV), indicates pH &gt; 7 - An output, included between 0 and +414.12 mV (7 x 59 mV), indicates pH &lt; 7 2.6 ORP - Oxidation Reduction Potential ORP is a numerical index of the intensity of oxidizing or reducing conditions within a system. Positive values for ORP indicate oxidizing conditions, whereas negative values indicate reducing conditions. ORP can also be viewed as a representation of electron availability. Since reducing agents donate electrons, a reducing environment is one in which electrons are relatively available. In contrast, an oxidizing environment is one in which electrons are relatively unavailable. Oxidation and reduction are related chemical processes that refer to the exchange of electrons in a reaction. Oxidation refers to when a chemical substance loses electrons. Reduction refers to when a chemical substance gains electrons, so reduction is the opposite of oxidation. Both oxidation and reduction can occur in the same reaction, which is why reactions involving oxidation and reduction are often called redox reactions. Chemicals (such as oxygen) that accept electrons from other compounds are called oxidizing agents, while substances (such as methane or hydrogen) that donate electrons are called reducing agents. Redox is expressed as electrical potential (voltage). Generally, a reducing environment is indicated by a negative reading, while an oxidizing environment is indicated by a positive reading. The most common unit for expressing redox potential is the millivolt (mV). 2.7 DO - Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen is the quantity of oxygen gas (O2), dissolved in water.  In general, natural chemical processes dissolve gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the water until saturation is reached. The amount of oxygen that can be absorbed depends on many factors, such as temperature, salinity and pressure. The greatest consumption of oxygen in water occurs through the respiration of animals, microbes and plants, but also through the decomposition of dead organic matter by microbes and fungi. Additionally, dissolved oxygen can decrease when the water body warms. In fact, for the preparation of anaerobic medium, the solutions are placed on a hot plate in order to cause the oxygen leakage, and to create an anaerobic environment. Dissolved oxygen is usually reported in milligrams per Liter (mg/L), in parts per million (ppm) or micromoles (umol). The oxygen concentration is also expressed as a percentage of saturation, which is the amount of oxygen present compared to the maximum value (100%) which could be contained in a specific air volume. 2.8 Conductibility (spc) Electrical conductivity, also called EC value (EC means “electrical conductivity”), is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity. The SI unit of conductivity is Siemens per meter (S/m). This parameter depends on the substances dissolved in a solution. Conductivity measurements are routinely used in many industrial and environmental applications as a quick, economical, and reliable method of measuring the ionic content in a solution. In many cases, conductivity is directly linked to total dissolved solids (TDS). 2.9 TDS - Total Dissolved Solids Total dissolved solids (TDS) is a measure of the combined dissolved content of all inorganic and organic substances present in water. Total dissolved solids (TDS) include inorganic salts, primarily calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates, and some small amounts of organic matter that are dissolved in water. TDS concentrations are usually in parts per million (ppm). 2.10 Salinity The salinity describes the amount of dissolved salts in a liquid. In most cases, sodium chloride (NaCl) represents the largest percentage of dissolved salts. Typical units for salt content are g/kg (g salt per kg of solution), %, ppt or even PSU. There is a proportionality between the salinity and conductivity. If a salt content increases, the conductivity value increases. For this reason, the salinity values can be calculated, if the conductivity value is known. 2.11 Density The density of a substance is the ratio between the mass of the substance and volume (how much space it takes up). Its unit of measure in the International System is kg/m3. 2.12 Alcalinity Alkalinity is a measure of water’s ability to resist pH changes that lead to acidity, or to neutralize acids and maintain a stable pH. This capacity is usually referred to as the “buffer capacity” of water. The presence of some chemical substances, including hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, affects the alkalinity of water. In simple terms, water with high alkalinity is less likely to become more acidic if it is contaminated with acidic water, such as acid rain. Alkalinity is measured by a process called titration. An acid of known concentration, called a titrant, is added to the water.The amount of acid used to bring the water up to a specific pH level is determined by the alkalinity of the water. Once the water reaches the pH end point, it changes colour. Alkalinity is measured in units of milligrams per liter (mg/L) of calcium carbonate \\((CaCO_{3})\\). Alkaline water has a pH of 8 or higher. The pH scale is used to measure the alkalinity of water.Water with a pH between 8 and 10 is considered slightly alkaline, while water with a pH above 10 is considered very alkaline. A pH of 7 is neutral, while anything below 7 is considered acidic. 2.13 Melting Temperature It can refer to: Melting point: is the temperature at which a substance changes from a solid to a liquid state Melting temperature: is the temperature at which the DNA double helix dissociates into single strands. 2.14 Gas laws \\(Henry’s law\\) The solubility of a gas in a liquid sample is directly proportional to pressure gas on the liquid phase. Example: in a carbonated drink, the carbon dioxide (gas) is present and it exercises a pressure in the bottle, higher than atmospheric pressure, which allows it to be soluble in the liquid phase. When the bottle is opened, the carbon dioxide pressure decreases with the consequent decreasing of its solubility. The observed result is the leakage of many bubbles from the liquid phase. \\(Boyle’s law\\) At constant temperature, a gas volume is inversely proportional to subjected pressure P x V = k \\(Charles’ law\\) At constant pressure, a gas volume is directly proportional to its temperature V/T = k 2.15 Plate Tectonics Plate tectonics refers to a particular mode of convection in a planetary mantle, which is made of silicate rocks, and so far it is observed only on Earth. Earth’s surface is divided into a various plates that are moving at different velocities. The interaction between the plate boundaries cause most geological activities, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruption, and mountain building. 2.16 Subduction zones Subductions zones are a dynamic site of mass and energy exchange between the asthenosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, with significant implications for the evolution of the Earth’s surface and interior. In subduction zones, lithospheric plates are descending into the mantle, giving rise to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and concentrations of economic ores. Subduction’s delivery of crustal materials to the mantle means that it plays a primary role in cycling of terrestrial elements. On a larger scale, subduction drives plate tectonics, as plate movement is chiefly driven by the downward pull of oceanic slabs sinking into the asthenospheric mantle. Subduction generates strong thermal and chemical disequilibrium, leading to dehydration and hydration, mineral transformations, and partial melting of crustal and mantle rocks. This results in different types of subduction zone processes such as metamorphism, metasomatism and magmatism. Understanding these three types of geological processes is essential to the geochemical transfer from the subducting crust into the mantle. Crustal recycling at convergent plate boundaries has been accepted as the fundamental mechanism for geochemical heterogeneity of the mantle. 2.17 Microbial growth It is the increase in the number of cells in a population. Growth rate: indicates the change in the number of cells or cell mass per unit of time. The time interval during which two daughter cells are formed from a single cell is called generation. The generation time is therefore the time needed for a population to duplicate and is also called duplication time. Bacteria have different generation times depending on the specific conditions like available nutrients, environmental parameters. A complete bacterial growth curve, such as that obtained in a closed container (closed system or batch culture) can be divided into several phases: lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase and death phase. The growth of a bacterial population inoculated into fresh medium usually begins after a more or less long period of time called the lag phase. The speed of exponential growth is variable and influenced both by environmental conditions (temperature, soil, atmosphere) and by the genetic characteristics of the microorganism. The exponential growth of a batch culture cannot continue indefinitely, it is self-limiting. Generally the end of this phase is determined by the exhaustion of essential nutrients or by the accumulation of waste products released. In this case the cell population enters the stationary phase. Although there is no net growth (unchanged cell number), many cellular functions, such as energy metabolism and some biosynthetic processes, can continue in this phase. Some bacteria show cryptic growth at this stage, some cells divide, while others die, so the number of cells remains constant. If the incubation continues, the culture enters the death phase where the total cell count may remain constant while the viable count slowly decreases. When death is accompanied by cell lysis, both turbidity and total cell number decrease. Every organism grows in a certain pH range, within which it is possible to identify an optimal pH. The intracellular pH must remain close to neutral to prevent the destruction of acid or alkaline-labile cellular macromolecules. Different environmental pH conditions could lead to particular cellular adaptations adopted by bacteria to survive. 2.18 Binary fission The reproduction of bacteria occurs through the division of an individual into two daughter cells (cytokinesis) equal to each other and identical to the progenitor and is defined as binary fission. The time it takes for a bacterium to complete a complete growth cycle is variable and depends on various nutritional and genetic factors. 2.19 Biofilm Biofilms are mainly composed of microbial cells and EPS. EPS can represent 50% to 90% of the total organic carbon of biofilms and can be considered the primary matrix material of biofilms. EPS can vary in chemical and physical properties, but is primarily composed of polysaccharides. Biofilm-associated organisms also differ from their planktonic (freely suspended) counterparts in the genes that are transcribed. The solid-liquid interface between a surface and an aqueous medium (e.g. water, blood) provides an ideal environment for the attachment and growth of microorganisms. The basic structural unit of the biofilm is the microcolony. The proximity of cells within the microcolony (or between microcolonies) provides an ideal environment for the creation of nutrient gradients, gene exchange, and quorum sensing. Because microcolonies can be composed of multiple species, cycling of various nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon) through redox reactions can easily occur in aquatic biofilms and soil. Biofilms also provide an ideal niche for the exchange of extrachromosomal DNA (plasmids). Conjugation (the mechanism of plasmid transfer) occurs at a greater rate between cells in biofilms than between planktonic cells. 2.20 Absorbance 2.21 Calibration Curve "],["polygons-plot.html", "Chapter 3 Polygons Plot", " Chapter 3 Polygons Plot Written by: Donato Giovannelli In case you have not had enough plot and chart types, here come a new one: the Polygon plot. A Polygon plot [singular, Polygons plot, plural] is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. I have developed the concept for the polygons plot in late 2018 while working on our review Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context, published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology. While working on the review, I started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earth’s life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. I wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born! The first polygons plot appeared in Merino et al. 2019 Frontiers in Microbiology. If you find the plot interesting or useful, consider citing the Merino et al. 2019 paper. More information about how to cite the Polygon plot are available at the section how to cite 3.0.1 Polygon plot features Polygon plot have many features that makes them unique and convenient to show multivariate ranges and a number of statistical properties. It is possible to plot from 3 to 6 variable in a single 2D plot (potentially more, depending of big your final plot will be) The showed range can be the interval minimum-maximum, interquartile range or any other interval You can add the mean (arithmetic, geometric, etc…) as a single line running through the plot You can easily use the shape of the polygon plot to categorize you observations into discrete groups having a similar multivariate distribution of the ranges for the selected variables Soon(ish) you’ll be able to plot the boxplot or density plot on the outside of each axis You can use the perimeter of the axis projection or the area of the polygon to sort you polygons plot array or query your visualization based on extension of the range of variables visualized A word of caution: While it defines a space on a plane that can be used for algebraic operations to work on a series of plots (called a polygons plot array), it does not define the state space of the possible combinations of the visualized variables. Visualizing the polygon plot as the state space of possible instances might seem like an intuitive thing to do, but it is inherently wrong! You are have been warned! We are working on a R package to be able to make Polygons plot easily and add some of the functionalities we have imagined discussing these plots with Shaunna Morrison, Fang Huang and Anirudh Prabhu. For now, we have a beta Shiny app built by Fang Huang than can be used right now to create Polygons plot and download them as .png or .svg. You can find the beta of the app here: fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/. Fun fact! My friends refer to these plots as “Donato’s plots”! Keep reading to find out how to use and read polygons plot, how they were invented and how they stack against other popular choices for plotting multivariate data.

Gallery of Polygons 3.0.2 The inception While working on the review I started trying to put on the same plot multiple ranges of variables. The first choice was to use multiple boxplots. But while they are very robust and well known, it was difficult to portray the kind of information I was looking for. Boxplot had to be grouped by variable, making across variable comparison difficult, or by group, making across group comparison difficult. A lot of boxplots were required to put all the variable together, with way to much ink on the page. Messy. I did not like it. My planetary and life data used for the Merino et al. 2019 paper visualized as a boxplots. Searching the web I found forest plot, which in essence are a simplified form of bloxplot were the range is represented by a single line. The result is a series of parallel line (thus reducing the amount of ink, but also the amount of information reported) essentially suffering the same problems of the boxplot. &gt;The same data as above visualized as a Forest plot. The type of comparison I was looking for was similar to the information displayed by a spider chart (called also polar chart, radar chart or star plot among many other names). While not one of my favorite, spider chart are useful to visualize multivariate data in a single plot, and give more intuitive comparison of the distribution of the data among different variables between different plots. The problem arises when for each variable you don’t want just to plot a single value, but you want to show the data range (like minimum and maximum), or a combination of range and average. &gt;The same data as above plotted as spider plots plot. Ranges are difficult to visualize and sometimes impossible to plot, depending on the variable’s order. I started doodling through a series of option, and devising a series of rules. Soon I started converging on the idea that polygons were the best solution to visualize ranges for n-variables. 3.0.3 Reading the Polygon plot Reading a polygon plot is easy. The plot has 3 to 6 axis representing the different variables to be visualized. The range (for example minimum-maximum values) are plotted as a segment parallel to its corresponding axis. The different segments are linked together to form a polygon. The resulting polygon might have up to 2x the variable number. This is due to an arbitrary space inserted between the different axis to improve readability and avoid plotting artifacts (called offset). Single values are plotted as a point (vertex), while missing value are represented by a missing edge on the data polygon. The multivariate space is defined by the resulting polygon. The mean for each variable can be represented by a single point and connected by a line. A word of caution: The multivariate space defined in the 2D plane by the polygon plot does not define the state space of the possible combinations of the visualized variables. Thinking of the polygon plot as the state space of possible instances might seem like an intuitive thing to do, but it is inherently wrong! You are have been warned! &gt;Anatomy of a polygon plot, with all the main characteristic explained. 3.0.4 Using the Polygon plots: the Shiny app While we are working toward a R package to be able to use polygon plots and their functionalities (Help us by contributing!), Fang Huang has built a Shiny app than can be used to create Polygons plot. The resulting plots can be download as .png or .svg. You can find the beta of the app here: fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/. Data can be provided as .csv file to the app in one of three ways (also mixing them in the same data file): Table of the formats that can be provided to the polygon plot app |–|–|–|–| You can find an example of the format in the app. Once you have uploaded the data file you can progress to step 2 and make you polygon plot. The Shiny app allows you to make only one plot at the time, but it has a nice number of functionalities. You can selected the variable number, you can select the offset, map different variables to the axis of your choice and vary aesthetics of the plot. Once you are done download the plot in your favorite format! 3.0.5 Polygons plot array Combining more than one polygon plot will give you what we call a polygons plot array. So far we have been using this term to refer to polygons plot that have 6+ plots, but this is totally arbitrary. Polygons plot array give you an excellent way to compare the range of a multivariate space across different sample/sites/observations very quickly. Our brain is very good in distinguishing different shapes, and pattern can be recognized quickly. &gt; An example of a polygons plot array sorted by area of the polygon. In polygons plot array the only rule to make it worthwhile is to keep the order, type, number and scale of the variables constant across all the different plots. Once you have the array you can potentially ask (and will be able to in the R package) questions based on simple geometric calculations. For example you can sort your plots based on the perimeter or the area of the polygon. You can use skewness or symmetries to sort your plots. We think in the future we will use image recognition to identify specific characteristics of the plot to classify it in the multivariate space. 3.0.6 List of future features Here an overgrowing list of possible features to be included in the R packages we are developing. We periodically update the list based on the feature request on GitHub, but head there for complete list. Also, consider contributing if you know how to code!
